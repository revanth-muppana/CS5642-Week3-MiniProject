This project is a deep learning solution for the [Kaggle Histopathologic Cancer Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/histopathologic-cancer-detection) competition. The goal is to build a binary classifier capable of detecting metastatic cancer in 96x96px digital pathology scans of lymph node sections.
